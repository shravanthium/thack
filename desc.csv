Situated in a high altitude cold desert at about 3500 meters above sea level, Ladakh is tucked in between the world's greatest mountain ranges, Great Himalayas and the Karakoram. It is also traversed by two other parallel ranges, Zanskar and Ladakh. As per geological studies, Ladakh was once a submerged portion of a large lake a few million years ago. Powerful tectonic movements pushed up the submerged mass to become the Ladakh of today. This is evident from the drainage basins Tso-moriri, Tsokar, and Pangong-tso, which are situated on the plateaus of Rupshu and Chushul of south-east Ladakh.
Historically, Ladakh had a kingdom of its own towards the 10th century and was ruled by dynasties, which were descendants of the kings of Old Tibet. The Himalayan kingdom of Ladakh reached the summit of its glory during the reign of King Sengge Namgyal in the 17th century. 
The silk route, which connected the plains of India to Central Asia and West Asia, flourished during this period. Textiles, spices, raw silk, carpets, dyestuffs and narcotics were the goods traded by the merchants during this period. Leh, the capital city of the Himalayan kingdom of Ladakh, gradually became a bustling entry point in this trade route.
Later, the kingdom of Ladakh, along with the neighbouring province of Baltistan, was incorporated with Jammu & Kashmir in the 18th century. Post Independence, Baltistan became a part of Pakistan whereas Ladakh remained with Jammu & Kashmir.

Jim Corbett played a key role in the establishment of the reserve.Formerly, some of the areas of this park were part of the princely state of Tehri Garhwal. In order to make the area less vulnerable for Rohilla invaders, the forests located within the region were cleared. However, a part of this region was ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Tehri. This was done by him so as to return favours to the East India Company as it had assisted the Raja of Tehri in ousting gurkhas from his land.A tribe of the Terai, which was known as the Bokas, settled on this land and began cultivation. However, in the 1860s, with the advent of British rule, this tribe was evicted from the land. After this, the control of the land was passed on to the hands of the British Forest Department. The department, after gaining control over the land, prohibited cultivation along with operation of cattle stations of this land.In 1907, the British administration focussed on the possibility of establishing a game reserve on this land. As a result of this consideration, in 1936, a reserve area known as Hailey National Park was established which sprawls across an area of 323.75 sq km. However, this preserve was renamed as Ramganga National Park in 1954-55, which was later renamed again in 1955-56 as Corbett National Park.In 1974, Jim Corbett National Park was chosen as the location for Project Tiger. At present, this national park is among the 13 protected areas, which is covered under the Terai Arc Landscape Programme by the World Wildlife Fund.This park does not authorise hunting, however it permits timber cutting for domestic purposes. Later, rules were passed, which prohibited killing and capturing of reptiles, mammals and birds.The best time to visit Corbett National Park is from November 15 to June 15. The park remains closed for the rest of the year as its roads are washed out during monsoons.

1205,In the south west of India and in the waters of the Arabian Sea, the island of Agatti forms a part of the Lakshadweep archipelago. The length of the island is about 6 km and the width is 1000 m approximately with a sparse population of around 7000.

The last king of Kerala, Cheraman Perumal, while traveling in the boats got shipwrecked in one of the islands near Agatti, but returned back safely. The people during this period travelled to Lakshadweep and settled there and gradually spread themselves across different islands. The presence of Islam and its followers in the island have been attributed to the preaching by St Ubaidullah in the 7th century, who by directions from the prophet in him, went to the islands and tried preaching Islam with partial success. Later on his wife carried on the preaching after the saint died where his mukbara or tomb in the nearby island of Androtte is still prayed by the muslim devotees. Briefly, the Portuguese tried to rule over the area for the coir products but were evaded by the local population. During the rule of Tipu Sultan, the previous influences of Chirakkal raja and Cannanore muslim houses were stopped and people were happy.

Panjim is the third largest city in the state of Goa after Vasco and Margao. It is situated on the bank of the river Mandovi. The name of the city after the year 1960 was changed to Panaji from Panjim. 
History of Panjim
Earlier it just a small fishing village known for the creeks, fields and coconut trees, until the year 1632, when it was linked to the village of Ribandar by the Viceroy of the time. As a result, a causeway was developed about 3.2 km long, which was the longest bridge in Goa at that time.   
During the Portuguese rule, the main capital was old Goa, which is now a World Heritage Site for its old churches and cathedrals. Due to the problems of floods and other epidemics at this place, the Viceroy at that time, Dom Manuel shifted his residence from old Goa to Panjim, at the Adil Shah Fort because of which there were protests.  
Panjim means the land that does not flood. During the rule of the Portuguese in Goa, Panjim was just a landing stage with custom housing facilities and was surrounded by marshy swampland. However, in the year 1843, it became a capital.   Although the rulers and Viceroys built some popular buildings and heritage sites, but the overall development was not up to the mark and the main reason for that can be attributed to frequent natural calamities. It was because of these the Portuguese nobles preferred to set their mansions in the countryside than the city. 
Things to do in Panjim
There are several natural beaches in Panjim, the nearest one to the capital being about 3 km to the western part of Panjim. Towards the downside of the capital is Dona Paula, which is a small town with many resorts that was earlier a fishing village. This part of the town developed gradually into one of the most visited tourist places in Goa and one of the highlights of Panjim tourism. There are numerous Panjim holiday packages that offer tourists the chance to visit all the famous sites of Panjim.
Dona Paula is the place where the estuaries of Zuari and Mandovi meet into the Arabian Sea. The beach derives its name after a Viceroys daughter jumped into the ocean after she was prevented from marrying a local fisherman. Her body is entombed in the Cabo Chapel.
Other than this town, the Baroque Church located on the main square consists of villas and cobbled streets with ancient architecture giving a glimpse of the Portuguese rule. The ruins of St. Augustines Tower that was built in the year 1602 and the Church of the Lady of Rosary located on the western side of the Basilica are other attractions in Panjim.

trade purposes. During this period, the city was referred to as Cochym, 
Cochin, Cochi and even Cocym.

The city of Kochi gained importance as a port in 1341 AD, when the port 
at Kodungallur was ruined by flooding of the Periyar River. In the 15th 
century, this port city began prospering, as the Portuguese penetrated 
the Indian Ocean. The first Portuguese factory was established by Vasco 
da Gama, while the first European fort in India was built by the 
Portuguese Viceroy, Afonso de Albuquerque. In 1635, the British settled 
in Kochi; however, the Dutch forced them out in 1663.

in Kochi. In 1866, Fort Kochi was converted into a municipality and its 
first Municipal Council election was conducted in 1883. Later, when

 to join the Indian Union willingly. In 1956, the state of Kerala was 
formed by the merger of Travancore, Malabar and Kochi.

Sasan-Gir or the Gir Forest National Park is located in the Indian state of Gujarat. Spread across an area of 1412 square km, this sanctuary was established in 1965 to protect the dwindling population of lions. Today, it is the only place where Asiatic Lions can be found, and that makes it one of Asias most important protected areas. 
The Gir National Park experiences a tropical monsoon climate with extreme hot and humid conditions during the summer months of May to August. The sanctuary remains closed to visitors during the summer months. Apart from being the only home of the reclusive Asiatic Lions, it also has various other species of flora and fauna, which give it a rich bio-diversity. 
It is estimated that this reserve in Gujarat has more than 38 species of mammals, approximately 300 species of birds and 2000 insect species. Of the mammals, the Asiatic Lion was counted at 411 a few years back.
Various efforts have been undertaken by the government and nature enthusiasts to preserve the rare species of lion. One of these efforts has been setting up of the Lion breeding programme. Under this program, breeding centres for the Asiatic lion have been set up in various parts of the state to increase their population. The centre also studies the behaviour of the Asiatic Lion and carries out advanced studies on this lion species. 
Things to do in Sasan-Gir
The sightseeing attractions of Sasan-Gir include a vast range starting from Sasan-Gir National Park, which is the most popular attraction in the place.

This dam is built over Hiran River, which is one of the seven rivers that drain in the area of Gir Sanctuary. Tourists can opt for Sasan-Gir holiday packages for a wholesome wildlife experience. 
The concerted efforts have reaped rich dividends with the population of Asiatic lions going up from 15 in 1990 to over 400 presently. However, this has posed a new problem for the authorities. Now, many believe that the Gir National Park is overpopulated and a part of the lion population must be relocated to a new place. 
A popular site, which was recommended for this initiative, is the Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary. This sanctuary, lying 65 away from the princely state of Junagadh, does not have well designated tourist areas. To overcome this problem and to protect the ecology of the area, interpretation zones have been set up to allow tourists to get close to nature while still protecting the wildlife.

860,Tawang, the birthplace of the 6th Dalai Lama, is one of the most beautiful places in Arunachal Pradesh. Lying between the latitude 27º45N and the longitude 90º15E, the destination is located at a height of around 10,000 ft above sea level. Home to the Monpa tribe, Tawang shares its border with Tibet in the north, Bhutan in the south-west and the Sela range in the east.It is believed that the place has derived its name from one of the oldest and largest Buddhist monasteries in India, Tawang Monastery. Perched on the edge of the ridge along the western part of this destination, Tawang Monastery is an important learning centre. About 400 years old, the monastery is believed to be home to more than 700 monks. Tawang Monastery was found in 1681 by Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso in compliance with the desires of 5th Dalai Lama, Nagwang Lobsang Gyatso.'Ta' means Horse and 'Wang' means Chosen. It is believed that the site on which the monastery has been constructed was chosen by the horse, which was owned by Merag Lama Lodre Gyamtso. According a legend, Merag Lama was unable to decide a location to establish the monastery. In order to seek divine guidance for choosing the construction site for the monastery, he was praying inside a cave. When he came out after finishing prayers, he found that his horse was missing. On searching, he saw that horse was standing on a hilltop. On seeing his horse on the hilltop, he considered this as a sign of divine blessing and finalised that location for construction of the monastery. The construction of this monastery was completed with the help of people residing in the neighbouring villages. At present, those same neighbouring villages are responsible for the upkeep of the monastery.Tawang Monastery is also popularly known as Galden Namgey Lhatse, which means celestial paradise. Before the construction of this monastery, Tawang was inhabited by the Monpa tribe. At that time, the Monpa tribe was under the rule of the Mon kingdom, which had their kingdom stretching from Tawang up to Sikkim. However, later the entire kingdom went under the control of Tibet and Bhutan.When India got its independence from Britain, Tawang was severed off from Tibet. In 1962, Tawang was conquered by the Chinese troops, who destroyed some portions of the monastery. For six months, the entire district was under the control of Chinese nationalist troops. However, after a retreat, it went under the control of India. Later in 1984, the district was separated from the West Kameng District.Owing to beautiful mountains and monasteries along with 100 lakes, today Tawang is one of the most sought out tourist destinations in Arunachal Pradesh. The destination celebrates several festivals throughout the year, which are mostly associated with religion and agriculture of Monpas. Some of the important festivals celebrated in Tawang are Losar, Torgya, Choekor and Dupka Tse-She. The Losar Festival, one of the most important festivals in Tawang, is celebrated by the Monpa community. It is celebrated for around two weeks, usually in February-March, to herald the Monpa New Year according to the lunar calendar.  The Monpas belong to the Mongoloid stock and form a majority of the population of Arunachal Pradesh. The festival is marked by feasts and spending time with family and relatives.  Houses are cleaned, lamps are lit, prayers are offered and prayer flags are hoisted. Masked dances, known as chaam, are performed by Buddhist monks in gompas to celebrate the triumph of good over evil. The festival welcomes the new, ushering in good health, peace and prosperity. Khapse, a Tibetan biscuit, is prepared during this time. It is made from a dough of flour, sugar and butter which is then shaped into different forms and sizes and deep fried. The most common shape is the twirled rectangular one which is shared with friends and relatives and offered to guests.  Other shapes include discs coated in sugar and long hollow tubes.Situated in the north eastern corner of the country, Tawang has limited connectivity to the rest of the country by air, rail and road.

                History of Mumbai
                
                 
                
Mumbai was originally built on an archipelago of seven islands, namely Bombay Island, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli and Old Woman's Island (Little Colaba). These islands have been inhabited since the Stone Age and were collectively known as Heptanesia. The region was ruled by dynasties like Satavahanas, Konkan Mauryas and Rashtrakutas, from the 2nd to 9th century BC.
              
The islands came under the control of the Silharas (810 to 1260), King Bhimdev (1261 to 1346), and the Delhi Sultanate (1347 to 1407). An independent Gujarat Sultanate governed the islands from 1407 onwards. Bahadur Khan Gilani of the Bahamani Sultanate tried to establish control over the islands in 1493, but failed.
              
During the European rule, Sultan Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate signed the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese on 23 December, 1534.

Ravana later built it in silver, Krishna built it in wood and Raja Bhimdev built it of stone. The Yadava kings of Vallabhi of Gujarat erected the second temple by around 649 AD on the same site. Junayad, the Arab governor of Sind, sent his troops to destroy the temple in 725 AD.  Nagabhata II of the Pratihara dynasty resurrected the temple in 815 in red sandstone. Mahmud Ghazni raided and destroyed the temple in 1024 AD. King Bhoj of Malwa of the Paramara or Panwar dynasty and the Chalukya King Bhima of Anhilwara rebuilt the temple in the period 1026  1042.

palms. Today, Khajuraho is known all over the world for its temples, 
which belong to the medieval Hindu and Jain period.

must leave worldly pleasures behind. The temples have numerous other 
sculptures depicting the life of a common man in that era.

India which has found many more underground temples at this site. The

615,Gokarna is a village in Karnataka, in the district of Uttara Kannada. Its situated on the coast of Karwar and lies between the rivers Gangavali and Agnashini.History of GokarnaThe name Gokarna is derived from two words, Go and Karna, and literally translates to cows ear. It is said that Lord Shiva was born here out of an ear of a cow. Another plausible reason for the naming of the place could be its geographic location. The area where it is located is the confluence of rivers Gangavali and Agnashini and resembles the shape of a cows ear. The early settlements of the region can be traced back to the Brahmins. They escaped from Gomantak to avoid the forcible conversions being executed by the British and the Portuguese. They came and settled in and around Gokarna in the 15th century and were helped by King Mayurvarma in their resettlement. King Mayurvarma was a Kadamba king of that era. Gokarna used to be a part of the kingdoms of Vijaynagar and Sodhe, before the Konkan region was forcefully taken over by the Portuguese. Gokarna also has a few mythological tales associated with it. According to one, Ravana, after receiving the Atmalinga from Lord Shiva, stopped here for his evening prayers while going back to Lanka. He had been instructed by Lord Shiva not to keep the Atmalinga on the ground, since it would be fixed wherever it touched ground. Atmalinga was a powerful weapon and Lord Ganesha did not want Ravana to get such a powerful weapon, fearing destruction. He then came in disguise, offered to hold the Atmalinga and then keep it on the ground. Ravana, in extreme anger, tried to pull out the Atmalinga from the ground, breaking it in the process. These pieces then resulted in the establishment of various temples in the village. Things to do in GokarnaApart from being a religious town, Gokarna is also known for its beaches.

Kasauli town is located at a distance of about 75 km from Shimla, 65 km from Chandigarh and 320 km from Delhi, at an altitude of about 1800 metres above sea level. The name Kasauli came from Kausalya, a mountain stream which flows between Kasauli and Jabli. The serene place of Kasauli has been mentioned in the epic Ramayana.

In the year 1814, the Governor-General of the British East India Company, Lord Amherst, decided to promote Shimla Hills as the gateway to the British establishments in India. As a result, Col. Tapp who was the political personnel at Sabathu Fort, a rejuvenating place for the British, came to survey the area of Kasauli.

Bounded by the Arabian Sea on its three sides and the rolling hills of the Western Ghats, the coastal town of Murudeshwara lies in between Honnavara and Bhatkal, on National Highway 17.
History of Murudeshwara
Murudeshwara town, earlier known by the name Mrideshwara, is named after the ancient Murudeshwara Temple of Lord Shiva. The ancient scriptures point to the existence of the town to the period of the Ramayana. 
As per legend, the Demon King Ravana brought Atma - Linga or Mahabaleshwara Linga - from Kailasa Parvata but Lord Ganesha placed it in Gokarna. Ravana, in great anger, flung the other parts of the idol such as the casket, the lid, the string around the lingam and the covering cloth of the idol to Sajjeshwara, Guneshwara or Gunavanthe, Dhareswara and Kanduka Hill of Mrideshwara respectively. The lid took the form of Vamdev Linga, the thread as Tatpurusha Linga and the cloth became Aghora Linga or Mridesa Linga.
Knowing about this incident from Lord Vayu, Lord Shiva, along with Goddess Parvathi and Lord Ganesha, visited these places and consecrated the lingas. He declared these lingas as his pancha-khshetras and also that worshipping these idols can wash off the sins of the devotees and transcend them from the cyclical re-incarnation of the soul by attaining Moksha.  
Mrideshwara was later renamed as Murudeshwara after the construction of the temple atop Kanduka Hill. Murudeshwara Temple is the chief attraction of the place with its 123 feet tall idol of Neelkanta or Lord Shiva and 249 feet high entrance tower, the Raja Gopura.

Formerly known as Prayag, Allahabad is situated on an island
peninsula. Located in the southern part of Uttar Pradesh, the beautiful city
stands at the confluence of three holy rivers -- Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati.
To the south and the west of Allahabad is the Bundelkhand region, while to the
east of the city is the Baghelkhand region.
According to Hindu mythology, the land was chosen by Lord
Brahma, the creator, for 'Prakrishta Yajna'. Since then, the city was known as
'Prayag' and was believed to be blessed by gods. Foreseeing the sanctity of
Allahabad, the place was named as 'Tirth Raj' by Lord Brahma, which means King
of all Pilgrimage Centres. Besides being a major pilgrimage centre, the city
also holds an important position in the formation of modern India.
When Allahabad was annexed in 1193 by Muhammad of Ghor, the
city became a part of the Delhi Sultanate. In 1526, the Mughal invasion of
India began, after which the city became a part of their empire. Emperor Akbar
founded Allahabad by the name of 'Illhabas' in 1575 AD, meaning the City of
Allah, which has now become Allahabad. 
During the medieval period, this holy city of Uttar Pradesh
enjoyed the honour of being a religio-cultural centre of India. For a long
period, the city was the provincial capital of the Mughals, which was later
captured by the Marathas. 
The British history of Allahabad began in 1801 AD, when the
Nawab of Oudh ceded the city to the British throne. The famous Allahabad Fort,
constructed by Akbar, was used by the British army for their military purposes.
By 1857 AD, the city became the centre of the war of
Independence and thus played a crucial role in the Indian Freedom Movement
against British Rule. In 1858 AD, India was officially handed over to the
British Government by the East India Company.  After the first War of
Independence, the city was made the capital of the United Province of Agra and
Oudh.
Thus, the city was the heart of the Indian Freedom Movement
with Anand Bhawan being its epicentre. It was in this beautiful city that the
Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi proposed his program of non-violent
resistance against the British to liberate India.
Synonymous to Sangam, Allahabad is one of the holy cities of
Uttar Pradesh, where the Maha Kumbha takes place once in 12 years. Magh Mela is
held annually, apart from the years of Maha Kumbh and Ardh Kumbh. 
This Magh Mela is called so, as it falls in the Magh period
(Jan-Feb) of the Hindu calendar. It is believed that taking a dip at the sangam
will free the devotees from sin or guilt. During this period a township will be
arranged to accommodate several pilgrims on the banks of River Ganga. Millions
of devotees from various parts of India participate in this auspicious mela.
Allahabad
is easily reachable from different parts of the country by air, rail and road. The
city has a domestic airport, which is situated around 15 km away from the city
centre and connected to different regions of the country. Taxis are available
from the airport. Allahabad is also a major rail station and has trains
connecting it to all the regions of the country. The city is well connected to
regions within and around the state by state as well as private buses. Buses also
connect Allahabad to Delhi and Kolkata, among other places.

Lord Shiva was delighted with Kolans dedication and granted his wish that a Swayambu Lingam would appear for daily worship. There is another story behind the temple. Adi Shankaracharya had a vision of Mookambika Devi and had the deity installed here. As he was meditating on the Kodachadri Hills, the Devi appeared before him in the form of an incarnation and asked him his wish, whence he replied that he wanted to install her deity in a place in Kerala. The Devi agreed to his wish but told him that she will follow Shankara and he should not look back till he reached the destination. In order to test him, the Devi deliberately stopped the sound of her anklets near Kollur and Shankar looked back. At this, she asked him to install her vigraha immediately at the place.

1181,One of the largest districts of the Indian state of Uttarakhand is Tehri-Garhwal. The district is nestled between the districts of Dehradun, Uttarkashi and Rudraprayag. The district derives its name from the word Trihari, which means a place which absolves the three sins evolving out of Mansa, Vacha and Karmana. The word Garh in Hindi refers to Fort, thus Tehri-Garhwal is believed to be a place of religious significance which can absolve man of his sins.Prior to the 9th century, Tehri-Garhwal was divided into 52 different forts which were ruled by different rulers. It was ruler Kanakpal who united the 52 garhs and formed one consolidated kingdom. The Kingdom of Garhwal used to be ruled by the Shah dynasty and was a princely state.  It was in 1949, two years after independence that this princely state became a part of India. Tehri-Garhwal was also ruled by the Gorkhas in the 19th century. The Gorkhas captured Garhwal in 1803 and soon spread their reach to the nearby areas of Dehradun, Saharanpur, Kangada and Simla. In 1815 the Gorkhas were defeated by the British army resulting in the signing of the Suguali Treaty. From 1815 until the end of the British Rule in India, the Garhwal kingdom was ruled by the British. During their rule, the British merged east Garhwal, Kumaon and Dehradun into one region while west Garhwal was converted to Tehri Riyasat. It was after Garhwal became an Indian state that Tehri Riyasat was merged with Garhwal to form Tehri-Garhwal. Tehri-Garhwal has religious significance too. It is said that Lord Brahma meditated here before creating the universe. Because of its high altitude, the place experiences a cool climate.

It shot to fame due to the world famous heritage sites of Ajanta and Ellora Caves.The historical city of Jalgaon was attacked and taken over by many ancient dynasties. Though the early history of Jalgaon is ambiguous, it was a part of the Rasika region. Rasika was conquered by the Farqui kings and henceforth Jalgaon came to be known as Khandesh. As per some records, the name Khandesh came from the Khandava forest, which is mentioned in the Mahabharata. Abul Fazl, a renowned historian belonging to the Mughal court, was of the opinion that the name Khandesh was derived from the "Khan" title given to Malik Nasir, the second of the Faruki kings, by Ahmad-I of Gujarat. According to the inscriptions found in the rock temples and caves of Nasik and Ajanta, Khandesh was under the rule of those kings who followed Buddhism from 1 AD  3 AD. The Satavahana dynasty, Andhrabhrityas, Virsen (Ahir King), Yawan dynasty, Chalukya dynasty and the Yadavas were the dynasties that came, conquered and ruled Khandesh for the next few centuries. Khandesh had also been under the control of Ala-ud-din Khilji, Mohammad bin Tughluq, Malik Raja Malik Nazir, the Nizams of Hyderabad, and the Marathas.  Khandesh was captured from the Holkar dynasty by the British troops during the 18th century. Robert Gill of the British East India Company was the first officer who ruled over Khandesh. Dhule was the headquarters of Khandesh under the British rule.

During his rule, the Tamils were free to migrate in the high ranges of the Western Ghats and around places like Kanjirapally and Aruvithura. As the hilly areas of trade routes were guarded by the Pandiyans, it was easy and safe for the trade caravans to arrive in the area.The first Tamil clan to move to Kanjirapally from the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu in around 1150 AD were the 'Kannannur Chetties', whose ancestry can be traced to a village in Chettinad. Traders by cast, they brought cloth, metal-wares, pulses, jewels, grain, tobacco and opium for sale in the region.

Formerly a part of the territories of the Haihaya Rajput kings of Chhattisgarh, Bhandara was taken over by the Ponwars in the 12th century, followed by the Gond chiefs.By the 17th century, the district was made a part of Berar by Peshwas, who had invaded the region during the period. In 1699, the region came under the control of Parasoji Bhonsle along with the territories of Gondwana, Devgad, Chanda and Berar. Raghoji Bhonsle of Vidarbha took over the charge in 1743, and was preceded by his son Janoji after his death in 1755.
